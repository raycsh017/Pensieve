# Functional Reactive Programming

## Overview
Functional Reactive Programming is a combination of two other concepts:
1. **Reactive Programming**: Focuses on asynchronous data streams, which you can listen wto and react accordingly. 
2. **Functional Programming**: Emphasizes calculations via mathematical-style functions, immutability and expressiveness, and minimizes the use of variables and states. 

Some of the benefits are:
- Simple, yet powerful
- The declarative approach makes code more understandable
- Complex flows become easier to manage and represent
