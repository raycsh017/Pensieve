## Problem Solving Steps
### Clarification of the problem - **Ask Questions!**
For example, if given a question such as "Delete the nth to last item from a list", do not start coding immediately. Ask:
- What type of list are we discussing? "A linked list"
- Is this a singly-linked list or doubly-linked list? "Singly-linked list"
- Is space complexity important? "No, but time complexity is"
- In that case, is a recursive solution acceptable? "Yes, but it would be nice to see an iterative solution as well if we have time"
- And, you get the idea. 

### Solve the problem algorithmically first. 
- Talk about your approach to the problem. 
- Draw out a small sample set of data to serve as a guide
- Write a bit of pseudocode, in step fashion, explaining each step
- Begin to write real code and talk about it
- Test your code against the data set you created
- If you have time, write test cases

Brute force is okay. Just make sure to optimize it later, if you have time. 

## "Minor" Tips
- Don't let negative interview loops discourage you
- Bring your own thin white board marker
